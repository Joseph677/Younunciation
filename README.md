## Brief introduction
This project is an attempt to figure out the way Youglish website was made, specifically the inner workings and backend of the website. It is also was an experience in implementing user authentication using Supabase and learning react components, states and props. Supabase also provided the database; a key factor in the approach implementation.

## instructions

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase API key (auth & app call only, to try the approach go to the deployment section below):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
